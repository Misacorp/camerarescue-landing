      <p>Our dream is to contribute to the global analog photography community by doing what we do best. In celebration of Finland's 100th anniversary we are uniting the mechanical camera expertise of our small engineering nation under one common goal &ndash; to rescue 100,000 cameras by 2020. For us, rescuing cameras is the act of finding new, loving homes for cameras that suffer from neglect or need to be repaired due to misuse.</p>
      
      <p>By late 2017 we have rescued over 35,000 cameras from Finland alone, but to achieve our goal we are reaching out to the world.</p>

      <p class="align-left">While we rescue 100,000 cameras, we also aim to pass on the expertise of mechanical camera maintenance and manufacturing to a new generation. We need there to be ample competent mechanical cameramakers in 2040. The following companies are working to achieve this goal.</p>
